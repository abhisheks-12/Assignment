Create a nice looking contact us page with first name, last name, email, message, additional details and send button. 
The form should have suitable validations on the form fields (e.g. number not allowed in the name field). 
When a user submits the form without filing the mandatory fields, 
the form should display the error messages highlighting which fields are invalid. 
When a user submits a valid form, all the messages should be displayed on a table. 
The table should have a sorting, searching and pagination functionality.
